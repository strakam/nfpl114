- Considering a neural network with $D$ input neurons, a single hidden layer
  with $H$ neurons, $K$ output neurons, hidden activation $f$ and output
  activation $a$, list its parameters (including their size) and write down how
  the output is computed. [5]

- List the definitions of frequently used MLP output layer activations (the ones
  producing parameters of a Bernoulli distribution and a categorical distribution).
  Then write down three commonly used hidden layer activations (sigmoid, tanh,
  ReLU). [5]

  descent and minibatch stochastic gradient descent. [5]

  to optimum almost surely. [5]

- Write down the mini-batch SGD algorithm with momentum. Then, formulate
  SGD with Nesterov momentum and show the difference between them. [5]

- Write down the AdaGrad algorithm and show that it tends to internally decay
  learning rate by a factor of $1/\sqrt{t}$ in step $t$. Then write down
  the RMSProp algorithm and explain how it solves the problem with the
  involuntary learning rate decay. [10]

- Write down the Adam algorithm. Then show why the bias-correction terms
  $(1-\beta^t)$ make the estimation of the first and second moment unbiased.

#### Questions@:, Lecture 3 Questions
- Considering a neural network with $D$ input neurons, a single ReLU hidden
  layer with $H$ units and softmax output layer with $K$ units, write down the
  explicit formulas of the gradient of all the MLP parameters (two weight matrices and
  two bias vectors), assuming input $\boldsymbol x$, target $g$ and negative log
  likelihood loss. [10]

- Assume a network with MSE loss generated a single output $o \in \mathbb{R}$,
  and the target output is $g$. What is the value of the loss function itself,
  and what is the explicit formula of the gradient of the loss function with
  respect to $o$? [5]

- Assume a binary-classification network with cross-entropy loss generated a single output
  $z \in \mathbb{R}$, which is passed through the sigmoid output activation
  function, producing $o = \sigma(z)$. If the target output is $g$, what is the value
  of the loss function itself, and what is the explicit formula of the gradient
  of the loss function with respect to $z$? [5]

- Assume a $K$-class-classification network with cross-entropy loss generated a $K$-element output
  $\boldsymbol z \in \mathbb{R}^K$, which is passed through the softmax output
  activation function, producing $\boldsymbol o=\operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol z)$.
  If the target distribution is $\boldsymbol g$, what is the value of the loss
  function itself, and what is the explicit formula of the gradient of the loss
  function with respect to $\boldsymbol z$? [5]

- Define $L_2$ regularization and describe its effect both on the value of the
  loss function and on the value of the loss function gradient. [5]

  initialization? [5]
